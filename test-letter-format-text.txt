SRILA PRABHUPADA'S LETTERS
November 7, 1976

Letter to: Bhagavan dasa
Location: Paris

My dear Bhagavan dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 20, 1976, and I have noted the contents.

Regarding your questions about the preaching work in Europe, I am very pleased to hear of the progress you are making. The people of the western countries are taking to Krishna consciousness very seriously, and this is all due to your sincere efforts.

Continue to distribute our books and hold sankirtana programs. This is the most important work. When people read Srila Prabhupada's books, they will naturally become attracted to Krishna consciousness.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada
